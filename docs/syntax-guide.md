# Syntax Guide

`intl-codegen` supports both `fluent` and `MessageFormat`.

## Fluent

Please see the official [fluent guide](https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/)
as well as the [fluent playground](https://projectfluent.org/play/).

Currently, `intl-codegen` does _not_ support `attributes`, `terms` and
message references.

## MessageFormat

There are some [guides](https://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/) for the
MessageFormat syntax out there.

Currently, `intl-codegen` does _not_ support plural offset and the special `#`
placeholder inside plurals.
